  const { pricing, priceText, isOnSale, discountText } = useProductPricing(product);
  const { inventory, badge, stockText, isAvailable } = useInventoryStatus(product);
  const { handleClick, handleImpression, impressionRef } = useProductInteraction({
    sourceComponent: 'product_grid',
    positionIndex: index
  });
  ```

- **Pricing Integration Examples**:
  - Display: `pricing.displayPrice` → "$24.99" or "from $19.99"
  - Sale pricing: `pricing.originalPrice` → "$29.99" with line-through
  - Discount: `pricing.discountPercentage` → 20 (for "20% off" badge)
  - Validation: `pricing.hasVariablePricing` → true/false for "from" prefix logic

- **Inventory Integration Examples**:
  - Stock status: `inventory.status` → 'in_stock' | 'low_stock' | 'out_of_stock'
  - Badge display: `badge.text` → "Sale" | "New" | "Low Stock" | null
  - CSS classes: `cardClasses.cardClasses` → opacity and interaction styles

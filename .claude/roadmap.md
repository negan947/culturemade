# CultureMade Development Roadmap
**Complete Production E-Commerce Platform for Clothing Store**

## üéØ Project Overview

**Vision**: Build a production-ready e-commerce platform for a clothing store with a unique iPhone simulation interface for customers and a traditional admin dashboard for management.

**Scope**: Small clothing store functionality (like opening a store on Shopify) with our distinctive iPhone interface.

**Current Status**: Foundation complete (95%) - iPhone shell, auth system, database ready. **Need to build**: Core e-commerce business logic.
---

## üìä Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FOUNDATION** (95% Complete)
- **Development Environment**: TypeScript strict, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Sentry
- **Database**: 20 tables with RLS policies, all relationships defined
- **iPhone Interface**: Hardware simulation, lock screen, home screen, app switching
- **Authentication**: Complete login/register/reset system with session management
- **Basic Apps**: Calculator, Weather, Components apps functional
- **Redux State**: Interface and notification state management

## üìä **Current Priority**

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Phase 1.1.2**: Build core Product API endpoints (Task 1.1.2 - Product Image Storage)
2. **Phase 1.1.3**: Create basic admin product management to support development 
3. **Phase 1.2**: Build CultureMade iPhone app structure (CRITICAL - required before cart/shopping features)
4. **Phase 1.3**: Add shopping cart system INSIDE the CultureMade app

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FIX:**
- **App-First Requirement**: CultureMade iPhone app structure must exist before cart, checkout, or account features
- **Dependency Chain**: Product APIs ‚Üí Admin Tools ‚Üí iPhone App Structure ‚Üí Shopping Features ‚Üí Checkout
- **Container Architecture**: All shopping functionality (cart, account, checkout) happens INSIDE the CultureMade iPhone app
- **Development Logic**: Cannot build shopping cart without the app interface where it lives

**STRATEGIC REORGANIZATION RATIONALE:**
- **Admin-First Approach**: Basic product management moved to Phase 1 enables developers to easily add/edit products while building the iPhone interface
- **Development Efficiency**: No need to manually edit database or wait until Phase 4 to manage products
- **Testing Support**: Admin tools available immediately for content management during iPhone app development
- **Advanced Features Later**: Complex analytics and business intelligence remain in Phase 4 where they belong

**SUCCESS DEFINITION**: A working e-commerce clothing store with iPhone interface where customers can browse products, add to cart, checkout with Stripe, and admins can manage inventory and orders through a web dashboard.

This roadmap focuses on building a complete, production-ready clothing store with the unique iPhone interface, avoiding enterprise bloat while maintaining professional quality and comprehensive functionality.
